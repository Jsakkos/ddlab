9. Keep in mind that the options displayed do not necessarily correspond with the specific capabilities of the Observer D1. It is advisable to double-check that the correct filter cube is mapped to the desired channels (Imaging Setup > Advanced). The microscope typically has filter cubes installed for DAPI/CFP/GFP/YFP/DsRed.
10. Click the "Live"  button to see a live image of your sample. When you are satisfied with the field of view, click "Snap" to capture the image.

## Troubleshooting

### Transmitted light channel is dark
- Ensure that live view is on
- Try increasing the intensity of the TL source by turning the TL knob on the front of the microscope stand.
