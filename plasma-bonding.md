# Plasma Bonding

Microwell chambers made from PDMS are hydrophobic and need to be treated with a plasma cleaner to allow the wells to be initially filled. This process introduces hydroxyl groups onto the PDMS surface, making it more hydrophillic and also allowing bonding between treated glass surfaces.
