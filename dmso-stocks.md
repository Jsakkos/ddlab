# Long term storage of Synechococcus strains:
**TL;DR Store strains in 0.5% DMSO.**

- Take 3 mL of cells from mid to late exponential cultures and pellet by centrifugation.
(These can be divided into 1.5mL portions and centrifuged on desktop centrifuges at max power for ~5 minutes or larger volumes can be handled in Falcon tubes in the large Sorval rotor; 4000rpm for 10 minutes.  Spin down at 10C)

- Decant Supernatant

- Resuspend in 450µL of BG11 (without antibiotics). 

- Add 50 µL of 50% DMSO in deionized water (or 25µL of 100% DMSO).

- Inverting the tube several times to mix the resulting solution. 

- Place in a -80 degree freezer. 

## To revive culture

- To rejuvenate frozen cultures, the tube is removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw until 50µL can be withdrawn with a pipettor (the remaining cells can be returned to the freezer for future rejuvenation).

- These cells are introduced into BG11 media without antibiotics and placed in a light
environment at room temp to 32 degrees. Antibiotics are added later (typically after an overnight
period); this allows the cells to express the antibiotic genes and more fully recover from
the freezing process before being presented with antibiotics. After a day, these cells grow
at rates matching cells at the same density that have not been recently frozen.
