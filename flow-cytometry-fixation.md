# Flow Cytometry Fixation

## Reagents
1. 10X PBS
2. Paraformaldehyde powder (Sigma-Aldrich P6148-500G), located in cold room chemical storage
3. Hoechst stain or DAPI
4. NaOH

### Prepare fixation solution
- 2g paraformaldehyde
- 100 mL PBS (1X), use 10 mL PBS and 90 mL DI water if using 10X directly

1. Heat solution to 70°C in fume hood for 1 hr.
2. Cool solution to room temperature and adjust the pH to 7.2 with 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl.
3. Store protected from light ≤1 month at 4°C or freeze aliquots for up to 5 years.

*Do not heat the solution above 70°C. For best results, use only very pure preparations of paraformaldehyde (i.e., electron microscopy–grade). For intracellular antigens that are very sensitive to acid denaturation, use only freshly prepared fixation solutions.*

### Fix samples
- Fixation solution, 4°C
- PBS, 4°C

1. Pellet cells by centrifugation.
2. Resuspend cells in fixation solution and incubate for 15-30 mins on ice.
3. Wash twice with PBS.

### Stain DNA
- Hoechst stock solution (10 mg/mL in DI water) stored at 4°C
1. Add Hoechst to fixed cell suspension in PBS at 10-15 ug/mL and incubate for 30 mins at room temperature.
2. *Optional* Wash cells with PBS.
3. Store cells at 4°C until read to analyze by flow cytometry.
